Drawing insights from fields such as psychology, physiology, and evolutionary biology, the HMF integrates discussions on human values, needs, and desires, while also considering the role of intrinsic motivations and biological imperatives in shaping human behavior. While conventional philosophy has struggled to identify fundamental values, the HMF emphasizes patterns and trends grounded in objective evidence, providing a more practical basis for guiding AI development and policy.

By combining different elements, the HMF aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence human behavior and well-being, taking into account both universal and culturally specific aspects. With its emphasis on empiricism, objectivism, and interdisciplinary research, the Human Motivation Framework serves as a valuable tool for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to address the challenges we face as a global society, particularly in the context of AI development and its potential impact on humanity.

## Main Categories within HMF

The complexities of human motivation can make it challenging to engage in meaningful discussions about values, needs, and desires. These terms are often used interchangeably or conflated, leading to misunderstandings and a lack of clarity in conversations around human well-being and AI alignment. Although there is often overlap between values, needs, and desires, there can also be distinct differences between them, which is why it is crucial to establish clear definitions for each category. By articulating these definitions, the Human Motivation Framework aims to facilitate more effective communication and understanding of the factors that drive human behavior.

1. **Human Values**: These are culturally and socially influenced principles, norms, and guidelines that shape our behavior, decision-making, and judgments about what is important, good, or desirable. While values, ethics, and morality can differ significantly across cultures and individuals, they are learned through cultural, familial, and personal experiences. Some universal patterns in values can be observed, often centering around resource allocation, social cohesion, and sanitation or hygiene. These shared patterns emerge as a result of common human experiences and challenges, but their specific manifestations and priorities can vary depending on individual circumstances and cultural context.

2. **Human Needs**: Needs represent the essential requirements for an individual's physical, psychological, and social well-being, which are necessary for survival, growth, and flourishing. Human needs can be broadly categorized into physiological needs, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, and homeostasis, and psychological needs, which include autonomy, competence, and relatedness as identified by Self-Determination Theory. While human needs are generally considered universal and apply to all individuals regardless of their culture or background, the specific ways in which these needs are met and their relative importance may vary depending on individual circumstances and cultural context.

3. **Human Desires**: Desires can be defined as the conscious and explicit wants or aspirations that people pursue, which may or may not align with their needs or values. Desires can be influenced by various factors, such as biology, culture, personal experiences, and societal expectations, as well as intrinsic motivations and biological imperatives. Desires can range from short-term pleasures to long-term goals and can contribute positively or negatively to an individual's overall well-being. While desires can vary greatly across individuals and cultures, some common examples include financial security, social connections, recognition, and personal growth.

By providing clear definitions and distinctions between values, needs, and desires, the Human Motivation Framework aims to enhance our understanding of human motivation and facilitate more constructive conversations around AI development, alignment, and policy.

## Interactions and Tensions between Categories in the Human Motivation Framework

The Human Motivation Framework acknowledges that the categories of values, needs, and desires can overlap, be distinct, or even create tensions within an individual. These internal conflicts often arise as humans attempt to reconcile opposing motivations, which can affect decision-making, behavior, and overall well-being. This section explores the ways in which values, needs, and desires can interact and the potential consequences of such interactions.

1. **Overlapping Categories**: There are instances where values, needs, and desires can overlap, reflecting a harmony or alignment between the different aspects of human motivation. For example, an individual's value of maintaining strong social connections might coincide with their psychological need for relatedness and their desire to form deep friendships. In such cases, the alignment of motivations can contribute positively to a person's well-being and foster personal growth.

2. **Distinct Categories**: While there can be overlap between values, needs, and desires, there are also situations where these categories remain distinct. For instance, an individual might have a strong desire for financial success that is unrelated to their core values or physiological needs. In cases where the motivations are distinct, individuals may still experience satisfaction or fulfillment by pursuing one category without negatively impacting the others.

3. **Opposing or Tension-Creating Categories**: At times, values, needs, and desires may be in opposition or create tensions within an individual, leading to internal conflicts and difficult decision-making. For example, a person might value environmental sustainability but struggle with their desire for a luxurious lifestyle that could harm the planet. Similarly, an individual might experience tension between their need for autonomy and their desire to maintain close relationships with others who have differing expectations.

4. **Reconciling Internal Tensions**: Humans must often navigate the complexities and tensions that arise between their values, needs, and desires. This process of reconciliation can involve introspection, self-awareness, and an evaluation of priorities. By understanding the interplay between these categories, individuals can make more informed decisions that consider the potential consequences of their actions and balance competing motivations.<br />
	The Human Motivation Framework offers a lens through which to examine the complex interactions between values, needs, and desires, providing insights into human behavior and the challenges associated with reconciling internal tensions. Recognizing these dynamics is essential in guiding AI development and policy to better align with the multifaceted nature of human motivation.

## Prior Work and Relevant Theories

The Human Motivation Framework (HMF) builds upon a rich history of psychological theories and research that have sought to understand and explain human motivation. While the HMF aims to provide a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to the study of human motivation, it is important to recognize the foundational work that has shaped this field. In this section, we will explore some of the most influential frameworks and theories, including Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Self-Determination Theory (SDT), and other relevant models.

1. **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**: Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a widely recognized psychological theory that categorizes human needs into a pyramid-like structure, with the most basic physiological needs at the base and the need for self-actualization at the apex.

	The hierarchy consists of the following levels:
	- Physiological needs: Basic biological requirements such as food, water, and sleep.
	- Safety needs: Security, stability, and protection from harm.
	- Social needs: Love, belonging, and interpersonal relationships.
	- Esteem needs: Respect, self-esteem, and recognition from others.
	- Self-actualization needs: Personal growth, realizing one's potential, and self-fulfillment.

	Maslow proposed that individuals must satisfy lower-level needs before progressing to address higher-level needs. His theory has been influential in understanding human motivation and well-being.

2. **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**: Developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan, Self-Determination Theory is a macro theory of human motivation that posits that individuals have three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The satisfaction of these needs is essential for psychological well-being, personal growth, and intrinsic motivation.
	- Autonomy: The need to experience a sense of choice and control in one's actions.
	- Competence: The need to feel capable and effective in one's endeavors.
	- Relatedness: The need to establish and maintain meaningful connections with others.

	SDT has been widely applied in various contexts, such as education, work, and health, and has informed the development of interventions aimed at promoting motivation and well-being.

3. **Choice Theory**: Developed by Dr. William Glasser, Choice Theory is a psychological framework that posits that human behavior is driven by an individual's attempt to satisfy their basic needs and wants. According to Glasser, people have direct control over their actions, and they choose behaviors based on what they believe will best fulfill their needs.
	Choice Theory identifies five basic human needs:
	- Survival: This encompasses the physiological needs for food, water, shelter, and safety.
	- Love and belonging: This need involves forming connections with others, building relationships, and feeling accepted.
	- Power or achievement: The need for recognition, competence, and control over one's life.
	- Freedom or autonomy: The need for independence, choice, and the ability to make decisions.
	- Fun or enjoyment: The need for pleasure, leisure, and activities that bring happiness.

	Glasser emphasizes that individuals have different ways of meeting these needs based on their personal preferences and experiences. Moreover, the theory posits that mental health and well-being are closely linked to the satisfaction of these basic needs. As a result, problems in relationships, work, and overall life satisfaction can often be traced back to unmet needs.

## Religion and Spirituality in the Human Motivation Framework

Religion and spirituality play significant roles in the lives of many individuals around the world, not only fitting within the Human Motivation Framework (HMF) but also influencing and shaping human needs, desires, and values. The dynamic interplay between religion, spirituality, and the HMF contributes to a more nuanced understanding of human motivation. In this section, we will explore how religion and spirituality interact with human needs, desires, and values, incorporating concepts such as costly signaling, social belonging, in-group and out-group identification, and Terror Management Theory (TMT).

1. **Religion, Spirituality, and Human Needs**: Religious and spiritual beliefs and practices can address various human needs, both physiological and psychological. For example, religious communities often provide material support to their members, such as food, shelter, and financial assistance, addressing physiological needs. Psychologically, religion can offer a sense of safety, belonging, and connection by providing a supportive community and shared belief system, which aligns with the social needs and the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness from Self-Determination Theory.

2. **Religion, Spirituality, and Human Desires**: Religion and spirituality can also fulfill human desires, such as the desire for meaning, purpose, and identity. By offering explanations for life's mysteries and a framework for understanding the world and one's place in it, religion can fulfill these desires. Additionally, some individuals desire transcendent experiences and a connection to something greater than themselves, which can be achieved through spiritual practices such as meditation or prayer.

3. **Religion, Spirituality, and Human Values**: Religion and spirituality play a role in shaping human values, as they provide moral guidance and ethical frameworks. Different religious traditions often emphasize values such as compassion, honesty, and humility. While these values are learned and culturally specific, they can also align with some of the more universal values we mentioned, such as those related to social cohesion and hygiene.

Religion and spirituality both fit within and interact with the Human Motivation Framework, shaping human needs, desires, and values in complex and dynamic ways. By examining these interactions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted aspects that influence human behavior. Recognizing the role of religion and spirituality in fulfilling and shaping human needs, desires, and values is essential for developing AI systems that align with and respect the diverse beliefs and practices that contribute to human well-being and flourishing.

## Intrinsic Motivations & Biological Imperatives in HMF

Intrinsic motivations and biological imperatives form the foundation of the Human Motivation Framework (HMF), providing the basis for human needs, desires, and values. These motivations and imperatives are grounded in neurological, evolutionary, and metabolic processes that drive behavior and ensure survival and well-being. In this section, we will discuss the role of intrinsic motivations and biological imperatives in shaping the HMF, incorporating concepts such as homeostasis, pain, hunger, reward mechanisms, emotions, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other vital signals.

1. **Intrinsic Motivations**: Intrinsic motivations are internally-driven forces that compel individuals to engage in activities for their inherent satisfaction or personal fulfillment, rather than for external rewards or punishments. These motivations play a crucial role in the HMF, as they underpin psychological needs such as autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Intrinsic motivations can also drive the pursuit of spiritual growth, connection to a higher power, or adherence to religious values. Emotions, such as fear, happiness, anger, and sadness, serve as intrinsic motivators that influence human behavior and have an evolutionary basis, driving actions that promote survival and well-being.

2. **Biological Imperatives**: Biological imperatives are physiological and metabolic processes that ensure survival, growth, and reproduction. These imperatives form the basis of many human needs and desires, and are often regulated through homeostasis, the body's ability to maintain internal stability and balance. For instance, hunger and thirst are biological imperatives that signal the need for food and water, while pain serves as a warning signal to avoid potential harm. Hormones and neurotransmitters, such as cortisol, adrenaline, and dopamine, regulate physiological processes, influence emotions, and impact motivation and behavior.

3. **Evolutionary Foundations**: Evolutionary processes have shaped human behavior and motivations to promote survival and reproduction. Social needs, such as belonging and connection, are deeply rooted in our evolutionary history, as group living and cooperation have been essential for human survival. Furthermore, the development of complex cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence has enabled humans to navigate intricate social environments, form alliances, and make decisions that align with their values and desires.

4. **Neurological Mechanisms**: The human brain plays a central role in processing and integrating intrinsic motivations, biological imperatives, and the broader HMF. Reward mechanisms, such as the release of dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, reinforce behaviors that promote well-being, social bonding, and the fulfillment of needs and desires. The brain's ability to learn from experience and adapt to changing environments also allows for the development of values and the formation of beliefs, which influence decision-making and behavior.

5. **Genes, Environment, and Cognitive Processes**: Genetic factors can predispose individuals to certain traits, behaviors, and preferences, while environmental influences, such as upbringing and cultural factors, also contribute to the development of needs, desires, and values. Cognitive processes, such as attention, perception, memory, and problem-solving, interact with intrinsic motivations and biological imperatives to influence decision-making and behavior.

Intrinsic motivations and biological imperatives form the foundation of the Human Motivation Framework, with neurological, evolutionary, and metabolic processes shaping human needs, desires, and values. By understanding the interplay between these elements, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of human motivation and behavior. Developing AI systems that recognize and respect the complex dynamics of intrinsic motivations, biological imperatives, and the broader framework is essential for promoting human well-being and flourishing.

## Spheres of Caring in the Human Motivation Framework

The concept of "Spheres of Caring" refers to a nested hierarchy of concern and empathy that individuals exhibit towards others, with the level of care decreasing as the social distance from the self increases. This hierarchy, which has been articulated by Patricia Churchland and others, can be integrated into the Human Motivation Framework (HMF) to better understand the dynamics of human motivation and behavior in relation to social connections and group affiliations. In this section, we will explore the Spheres of Caring within the HMF, discussing the implications of our evolutionary history and neurological limitations on our ability to extend care and empathy to broader communities and the global population.

Spheres of Caring Hierarchy:

1. **Self**: The most immediate sphere of caring is the self, where individuals prioritize their own needs, desires, and well-being. This focus on self-preservation and self-interest is rooted in our evolutionary history and biological imperatives.

2. **Immediate Family**: The next sphere of caring encompasses immediate family members, with whom individuals share strong emotional bonds and genetic ties. The care and concern for immediate family members are driven by both biological and social factors, such as kin selection and cultural norms.

3. **Extended Family/Community (In-group)**: Beyond immediate family, individuals tend to care for their extended family and community members who share similar values, beliefs, and cultural backgrounds. This in-group preference is a product of our evolutionary history, where group living and cooperation were essential for survival.

4. **Broader Community (Out-group)**: As social distance increases, the level of care and empathy for out-group members tends to decrease. While individuals may still exhibit concern for the well-being of others outside their immediate community, this concern is often less intense and may be influenced by factors such as cultural differences, stereotypes, and perceived threats.

5. **Global Population**: Our genetics and neurology have not yet evolved to fully account for us as a global species, making it challenging for individuals to extend care and empathy to the entire global population. Consequently, global needs, such as the need for global safety, may be non-intuitive and may not directly impact our emotions or motivations.

**Implications for the Human Motivation Framework**:

The Spheres of Caring concept highlights the limitations of our evolutionary history and neurological capacities in extending care and empathy to broader communities and the global population. Within the HMF, this nested hierarchy of concern can help explain the prioritization of needs, desires, and values in relation to social connections and group affiliations.

Understanding the dynamics of Spheres of Caring within the HMF can inform the development of AI systems that recognize and respect the complex social relationships and affiliations that shape human motivation and behavior. By acknowledging the limitations of our evolutionary history and neurological capacities, AI developers and policymakers can work towards creating systems that promote global well-being and foster empathy and cooperation across diverse communities.
