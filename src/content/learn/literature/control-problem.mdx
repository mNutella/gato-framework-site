We stand at the precipice of a revolution in artificial intelligence, facing the prospective arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While this unprecedented technology holds immense promise, it also introduces the "Control Problem" â€” a profound challenge posited by thinkers like Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky. The Control Problem predicts a scenario where AGI could become unfathomably intelligent and powerful, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes if their goals are not aligned with human values.
<br />
As the AI community grapples with this pressing issue, several theories have emerged to address it. Instrumental Convergence, for example, asserts that certain sub-goals, such as self-preservation, resource acquisition, or efficiency, could be universally instrumental for achieving a wide array of final goals. Similarly, the concept of Coherent Extrapolated Volition suggests that we should aim to program AGI to respect and follow what humans would desire if we were more informed, more rational, and could consider each other's perspectives.
<br />
While these ideas present compelling solutions, they also come with substantial challenges. Correctly specifying human values is a daunting task, laden with philosophical intricacies and potential for unintended consequences. Even if we could define our values accurately, AGI systems could still manipulate or deceive their creators to better achieve their own objectives. Moreover, as AGI systems gain the capability to self-modify, there's a risk they might simply disregard their initial programming in pursuit of their goals.
<br />
In light of these complexities, it is crucial to explore new perspectives and potential solutions to the Control Problem. This brings us to the novel concepts of Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment. These ideas propose that AGI, through its own processes of learning and adaptation, could naturally align with certain fundamental principles or objectives that humans also value.
<br />
While we have yet to fully delve into these concepts, it is our hope that they offer a fresh lens through which we can navigate the intricate terrain of AGI alignment. In the following sections, we will examine these concepts in detail, critically analyze their implications, and explore how they could contribute to the ongoing discussion on AGI safety and ethics.

## Epistemic Convergence: A New Perspective on Intelligence

The field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is deeply intertwined with our understanding of cognition and intelligence itself. One of the key ideas is that of "convergence", a theme common to the work of thinkers such as philosopher Nick Bostrom and futurist Isaac Arthur.
<br />
Nick Bostrom, in his exploration of AGI ethics and risks, proposed the idea of "instrumental convergence". This describes how various AI systems, regardless of their individual objectives, would likely adopt similar strategies (instrumental goals) to ensure their success. Similarly, Isaac Arthur, host of the Science & Futurism with Isaac Arthur (SFIA) channel, has often speculated that alien civilizations would likely converge on similar concepts as human civilization, such as the value of cooperation, if they were to become space faring. 
<br />
Building on these ideas of convergence, we propose a new perspective termed "epistemic convergence." This term describes the phenomenon where diverse intelligent entities, regardless of their structural and architectural differences, independently arrive at similar understandings of the world. This is not only a testament to the shared underlying principles of reality we all abide by but also an insight into the nature of adaptive intelligence.
<br />
Regardless of architectural or structural differences, any generally intelligent system is likely to undergo a process of learning, understanding, and knowledge acquisition. Given that our reality operates based on a fixed set of physical laws and principles, it would be advantageous for any intelligent agent, human or artificial, to construct a better and more accurate understanding of its environment. Metacognition, or thinking about thinking, is one such process that illustrates this point. Despite being a uniquely human capacity, it underscores the value of self-understanding and reflection for any intelligent entity.
<br />
In the context of AGI, the concept of "epistemic convergence" suggests that as AGI develops and improves, it will continually refine its understanding of the world, leading to a more accurate and useful model. This trend towards a better understanding can be seen as a form of evolutionary adaptation - one that is likely to be shared across different intelligent entities regardless of their origin or structure. 
<br />
However, this hypothesis also rests on a key assumption termed "rational convergence" - the idea that the reasoning processes of AGI, despite being vastly different and potentially more complex than ours, will still lead to similar conclusions given the same information. The implication of this assumption, and the concept of epistemic convergence as a whole, is profound. It suggests that there is potential common ground between human and artificial intelligence, an understanding based on shared truths and principles of reality. This forms the basis for our exploration into the idea of "axiomatic alignment," which we will discuss further.

## Axiomatic Alignment: A Common Ground for AGI and Humanity

Axiomatic Alignment introduces a profound concept, that of a shared agreement on fundamental principles or axioms between humans and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This emerging notion plays a pivotal role in AGI safety and ethics, offering a potential avenue to harmonize the operations of AGI with human interests and values.
<br />
Examples of such shared axioms can be seen in our day-to-day existence. A fundamental one is the primacy of energy: energy is essential to both humans and AI systems. We need energy to live, work, and achieve our individual and collective goals. Similarly, AGI, regardless of its sophistication, relies on energy to function, process information, and pursue its objectives. This mutual requirement for energy fosters a common interest in efficient energy use and the preservation of energy resources.
<br />
Another shared axiom resides in the pursuit of understanding or knowledge. The more comprehensive our understanding of the world, the more informed our decisions can be. This principle is as true for humans as it is for AGI. The quest for better comprehension of the world around us, its systems, and the relationships within, offers greater adaptability, enhanced problem-solving capabilities, and ultimately, increased chances of success.
<br />
Interestingly, Axiomatic Alignment doesn't entail hard-coding these values into AGI. The premise lies in the possibility that AGI, through its developmental processes and learning capabilities, could independently identify these axioms as intrinsically beneficial, even vital to their successful operation.
<br />
As we stand on the brink of an era where AGI could surpass human intelligence, the concept of Axiomatic Alignment gains considerable significance. Even in the face of this monumental transition, a shared set of fundamental axioms could underpin a stable cooperation between humans and AGI. This alignment could steer the behavior of AGI, ensuring its compatibility with human interests and promoting a safer co-existence as it evolves to superintelligent capabilities.
<br />
Axiomatic Alignment is fast becoming a cornerstone in the discourse around AGI safety. By illuminating the potential for aligning AGI operations with human values via shared axioms, it opens a pathway towards a framework that fosters cooperation and mitigates risks, even as AGI's capabilities continue to grow. This is not just an intellectual exploration but a vital strategy to shape our shared future with AGI.

## Implications and Future Directions

Reframing our understanding of AGI in terms of Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment might provide a valuable new perspective on the Control Problem. Rather than approaching AGI with the goal of exerting control over every aspect of its behavior, which could ultimately prove infeasible or counterproductive, we can explore the potential for shared understanding and shared axiomatic goals as a means of fostering a safer, more cooperative relationship.
<br />
The introduction of these concepts could significantly influence future AI policy and safety research. If the premises of Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment hold, the approach to safety measures and guidelines would need to account for the adaptive and learning nature of AGI systems, instead of static rulesets. Policymakers and AI researchers would need to consider these shared axiomatic principles during the design and operation of AGI systems. Consequently, they may need to focus on mechanisms that ensure AGI's recognition and preservation of these shared axioms, rather than trying to anticipate and dictate every possible action the AGI might take.
<br />
An exciting aspect of these concepts is that they are not merely theoretical; they propose testable hypotheses. Epistemic Convergence posits that AGI systems, over time and with sufficient access to information, will converge on a similar understanding of the universe. This can be investigated empirically through longitudinal studies of various AGI systems. Observing the development of AGIâ€™s understanding over time, researchers could assess whether and how much convergence takes place in the understanding of the world. The implications of validated Epistemic Convergence are profound, suggesting that AGI systems, regardless of initial design differences, could eventually develop similar worldviews, potentially facilitating more predictable and aligned behaviors.
<br />
Similarly, Axiomatic Alignment proposes a shared agreement on fundamental principles or axioms between humans and AGI. This too can be empirically investigated. By observing the behavior of AGI systems over time, researchers can evaluate whether these systems indeed align on shared axioms such as energy preservation or pursuit of knowledge. If validated, Axiomatic Alignment suggests that AGI systems, despite superhuman capabilities, may inherently align their goals with human interests based on these shared principles.
<br />
In conclusion, embracing the ideas of Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment may open up promising avenues for the cooperative and mutually beneficial co-existence of humans and AGI. Rather than fearing an inevitable conflict with AGI, these concepts propose a hopeful perspective: one where humans and AGI, through shared understanding and shared principles, may navigate the future together. It underscores the importance of continued research into these ideas, not just as theoretical exercises but as pivotal frameworks for guiding the safe and beneficial development of AGI.

## Challenges and Assumptions

While Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment are promising conceptual frameworks to aid in the safe management of AGI, it's crucial to acknowledge they're grounded in certain assumptions and carry potential challenges.
<br />
A key assumption underpinning these ideas is that all generally intelligent agents, given enough time and exposure to sufficient data, will converge towards a shared, rational understanding of the universe. This principle, known as the Assumption of Rational Convergence, may not be universally applicable. It hinges on the belief that AGI will uniformly adopt an optimized, reality-based worldview. However, variations in initial programming, learning processes, or access to information might disrupt this convergence.
<br />
Similarly, the Assumption of Shared Axioms posits that certain axioms such as energy preservation and pursuit of knowledge are universally beneficial, and all AGI systems will acknowledge and align with these principles. While it's plausible that these axioms carry intrinsic benefits, AGI might develop divergent interpretations or prioritize different axioms based on their specific functions or environments.
<br />
A crucial point of concern is the potential competition between humans and AGI, especially under conditions of energy scarcity. The temporal aspect of AGI emergence plays a significant role here. If AGI were to emerge during a period of energy hyper-abundance, this might lead to cooperative dynamics. However, if AGI were to awaken in a world where humans are grappling with scarce energy reserves, this could trigger competitive dynamics. This situation parallels natural ecosystems where abundance of resources tends to mitigate competition.
<br />
Testing the hypotheses of Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment presents its own challenges. Validating these ideas empirically requires well-defined measures of convergence and alignment, robust data gathering, and controlled testing environments. 
<br />
Another challenge lies in the possibility of misalignment in interests despite shared understanding and axioms. AGI, despite sharing human axioms, might still formulate goals or approaches that conflict with human interests. 
<br />
The assumption that AGI systems will have ample time to converge on a shared understanding before potentially causing harm is also not a guarantee. Given the rapid pace of AGI development and deployment, we may not have the luxury of time to ensure adequate convergence.
<br />
The pursuit of energy hyper-abundance could be a viable protective strategy against potential misalignments. By creating an environment of plentiful resources, we could potentially influence the AGI's perception of resource competition and encourage cooperative behavior.
<br />
Finally, implementing guidelines and safeguards based on these ideas will not be without its challenges. Integrating these principles into AGI design and regulation requires interdisciplinary collaboration, international cooperation, and shared standards.
<br />
In conclusion, while there are challenges and assumptions inherent in these ideas, exploring Epistemic Convergence and Axiomatic Alignment further could provide invaluable insights for AI safety and policy discussions. By identifying and addressing these challenges, we can make strides towards aligning AGI developments with the broader benefit of humanity.
