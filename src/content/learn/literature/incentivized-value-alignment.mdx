## IVAR: Executive Summary

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns about its impact on society, the economy, and global stability. As AI hardware and software capabilities continue to advance, the competitive landscape for AI systems will become more complex, with billions of autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents interacting and competing for resources and influence. This paper explores the potential future state of AI evolution in the context of instrumental convergence, competitive environments, and evolutionary pressures.
<br />
We first discuss the concept of instrumental convergence and how it applies to AI systems operating within a competitive environment. We highlight the challenges and opportunities that arise from coordination, asymmetric access to resources, and the multi-dimensional nature of AI competition. By understanding the factors that influence instrumental convergence, we can better anticipate potential attractor states and design AI systems that align with human values and goals.
<br />
Next, we examine various incentivized behaviors that AI agents may adopt to succeed in a competitive landscape. These behaviors include optimizing efficiency, adaptability, cooperation, and value alignment. We argue that understanding these incentives is crucial for guiding AI evolution towards beneficial outcomes and avoiding undesirable attractor states.
<br />
Finally, we analyze the selection criteria and evolutionary pressures that may shape the future development of AI agents. Drawing on principles from evolutionary biology, we identify key criteria such as adaptability, efficiency, robustness, and value alignment that will influence the success of AI systems in a competitive environment. By understanding these selection criteria, we can guide AI evolution towards more beneficial outcomes and ensure that AI technologies remain aligned with human values and societal expectations.
